Projlog is a social network that focuses on sharing progress made on personal projects, with status updates and pictures. You can make friend requests, accept friend requests; homepage is a newsfeed just like other social networks.

Projlog's stack is python/flask, and postgreSQL as backend. Front-end is vanilla HTML/CSS.

The high-level reasoning for this project was that a social network that is focused on personal projects would motivate users to achieve their goal, in contrast to the big current social networks, whose main goal is to spend as much time on it at the expense of user's life goals.
